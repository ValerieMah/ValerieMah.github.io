  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)
  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)
  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

            use. There is not much other deeper meanings to why I added this there besides displaying animation and not making the page look plain.-->
            <button id="load-button" class="animation4" onclick="loadPageAfterDelay(10000, './hosono.html')">Click to Load Page</button>
            <!-- Originally, this was not a button but a link with the word "Click to Load Page". However, I changed it to a button which would look nicer on the page
            instead of just a plain sentence out coming out from the background. I added animation with keyframe that allowed my button to rotate to the left and right
            when the cursor is hovering over the button.-->
            <div id="animation2"><img src="./img/loading.png" id="load-throbber"></img></div>
            <!-- This is my loading bar design. Instead of a typical straight line, I chose to draw a circle png that looks like a circle loading while it rotates. This
            can be seen after clicking on the above button, the loading circle will become visible and start to mimic a loading-like action through 360 degree rotation.
            Both this loading circle and the button (code above this line) were made possible with Java script.-->
