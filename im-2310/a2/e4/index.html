        <!-- I chose to add the full screen function out of the other available fucntions because I considered that there is a video being played.
        If it was not for the video, I would have not even consider adding the full screen function since there won't be any use and purpose for it.
        The visuals of the video looks really good and seems to be something that can be played during parties due to it's stunning, bombastic and 
        extravagant motion graphic. Compared to the other available function choices, this function is the only function that can't be manually adjusted
        or obtained by. The other functions can be manually adjusted or be carried out manually by the users. Thus, to utilize and bring out it's 
        best potential, I chose this function out of the other available choices. -->
