    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h3>
    <h5>The lines used as the background and as the borders for each sections alignment.</h5>
    <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
    <h5>The first thing that I felt were in the way of this uniquely decorated website </h5>
    <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <h5>Scrolling and opening each links which showed the website owner's works and blogs.</h5>
    <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <h5>Scrolling through the very long pages of words and documents.</h5>
    <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <h5>To see different and unique websites.</h5>
    <h3>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
    <h5>There are a lot of weird and random websites that I didn't expect to be used. I explored other types of "Interactive" websites through this task.</h5>
    <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <h5>I guess it depends on the type of website- portfolio, sales, creative, games etc. I reckon a portfolio website should be easy to direct around the website, not contain too many </h5>
    <h3>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <h5>I didn't really enjoy the website. It looked really cool and all but like as I continued using the website, I found the website very inconvenient to use and with a misclick of a button, I may lose a content which I have yet to view from the page since the page is very difficult and over-designed by the designer.</h5>
