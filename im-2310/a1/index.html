    <h2><strong><u>Week 2</u></strong></h2>
    <h3><u>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</u></h3>
    <h5>The lines used as the background and as the borders for each sections alignment.</h5>
    <h3><u>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</u></h3>
    <h5>The first thing that I felt were in the way of this uniquely decorated website </h5>
    <h3><u>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</u></h3>
    <h5>Scrolling and opening each links which showed the website owner's works and blogs.</h5>
    <h3><u>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</u></h3>
    <h5>Scrolling through the very long pages of words and documents.</h5>
    <h3><u>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</u></h3>
    <h5>To see different and unique websites.</h5>
    <h3><u>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</u></h3>
    <h5>There are a lot of weird and random websites that I didn't expect to be used. I explored other types of "Interactive" websites through this task.</h5>
    <h3><u>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</u></h3>
    <h5>I guess it depends on the type of website- portfolio, sales, creative, games etc. I reckon a portfolio website should be easy to direct around the website, not contain too many </h5>
    <h3><u>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</u></h3>
    <h5>I didn't really enjoy the website. It looked really cool and all but like as I continued using the website, I found the website very inconvenient to use and with a misclick of a button, I may lose a content which I have yet to view from the page since the page is very difficult and over-designed by the designer.</h5>

    <h2><strong><u>Week 3</u></strong></h2>
    <h3><u>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</u></h3>
    <h5>A portfolio website.</h5>
    <h3><u>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</u></h3>
    <h5>To explore around the page to learn more about the owner. Data that should be found are biodata, previous works, work experiences, participations and more. With that in mind, the website should be easy to direct around while users are interacting with it. The website shouldn't be obstructive.</h5>
    <h3><u>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</u></h3>
    <h5>In my opinion, I reckon a portfolio website be visually simple and easy to navigate around it. The style of the website makes a huge effect to users who are using them. If the design is painful and irritating to look at, regardless of your amazing portfolio data, the readers might not necessarily have a good impression.</h5>
    <h3><u>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</u></h3>
    <h5>Definitely the visual style of the website. There are too many boxes and line all around the place. It hurts my eyes to see it. I understand that the user tried to make the website look unique by seperating the different sections in boxes but I don't think the visual helps. Instead of looking neat, it looks messier.</h5>
    <h3><u>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</u></h3>
    <h5>The envelope with a the link- to send a letter or enquiry to the owner. Misleading at first with the error but when it loads up, it looks really cool.</h5>
