        <p>For this assignment, I chose playful and feedback as my Abstract Adjectives and Interaction Design Principles. With that in mind, 
            I chose to make a dinosaur as it’s something that’s more towards the fun side which is playful. Elements such as vibrant colours 
            and the cartoon animation style can be considered playful. Whereas for feedback, the experience is unique so much so that it 
            changes the interaction the users have with the website while using it. Therefore, with this concept in mind, I decided to make 
            a website that features a cute dinosaur that allows users to watch the dinosaur walk around the webpage, hear the dinosaur roar, 
            and even learn some simple facts about the dinosaur (dinofacts). </p>
        <p>  Jumping into the features implemented onto the main interaction, we have the t-rex. The first thing that users will immediately 
            notice is the dinosaur walking from the left to the right of the screen while blinking. This was made possible with css style, 
            where I added keyframe so that animation can be added into the dinosaur png. The three keyframes are walking animation, the png 
            changing animation (dinosaur blinking), and the dinosaur turning. Then these keyframes were added into the animation id on 
            infinite (which will loop the animation). This was made so that the dinosaur looks like it’s alive and moving around on the 
            website. In class, we were only taught to rotate and flip the png. However, that would make the dinosaur look very odd instead. 
            Therefore, the code was made so that the dinosaur can actively walk around the screen which looks livelier.  Another feature that 
            was implemented to that animation was hover. With the user’s cursor over the dinosaur png, it’ll pause the walking and turning 
            but maintain the face changing png keyframe which will still make it look like the dinosaur is blinking and staring at the user. 
            I made this a feature instead of leaving it stagnant or doing nothing is so that it looks more realistic in terms of the dinosaur.  
            It creates a cute, happy, and soft experience for the user. Besides that, I also added a container that contains some simple 
            information about the featured dinosaur. This involved style css and java script. Upon hovering over the dinosaur, the container 
            that contains the information about the dinosaur will appear on the right side of the screen. Java script was used so that it would 
            change the visibility of the box which is set as hidden on default in the style css to visible. Last but not least, by left clicking 
            on the dinosaur, users will be able to hear it roar. I personally feel that adding sound into it is a nice touch to adding more 
            interactions and bring my dinosaur to life. This was added onto the dinosaur with a java script function- event listener. </p>
        <p>  Just a last interesting feature, the home starting page with the button at the bottom is made to be the play button to the background 
            music since chrome doesn’t allow users to have an autoplay background sound. With the button clicked, java script will hide that 
            background that is overlaying the dinosaur and other main background. The background music is set on loop, and I’ve added a mute 
            button on the top left to allow users to have the option of muting the background sound. 
        </p>

            <h1>Tyrannosaurus</h1>
            <p>Tyrannosaurus Rex, also known as T-Rex for short is was a large predatory dinosaur that could be found 
               68 to 65 million years ago. The T rex is a carnivore which a massive skull balanced with a long, heavy tail. 
               Compared to the large and powerful hind limbs, its forelimbs were small but powerful for their size. </p>
